<media:description>NASA will broadcast a Space Launch System (SLS) rocket full-scale booster test at 2:45 p.m. EDT Wednesday, Sept. 2, on NASA Television and the agency’s website, followed by a media teleconference. The Flight Support Booster-1 test builds on three full-scale development test firings and two qualification test firings NASA and Northrop Grumman successfully completed with the five-segment solid rocket motor in preparation for the first three Artemis missions. The Sept. 2 test at Northrop Grumman facilities in Promontory, Utah, will help teams evaluate potential new materials, processes, and improvements for the boosters that will power deep space missions beyond Artemis III. The test also will provide another opportunity to evaluate motor manufacturing and performance. About an hour and 30 minutes after the test, media will have the opportunity to participate in a teleconference with: Bruce Tiller, manager of the SLS boosters office at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama Charlie Precourt, vice president of propulsion systems at Northrop Grumman, in Promontory To participate, media must contact Kathryn Hambleton at 202-358-1100 or kathryn.hambleton@nasa.gov no later than noon Tuesday, Sept. 1. During the broadcast, anyone can submit questions on Twitter using the hashtag #AskNASA. Updates on the test will be posted on the Artemis blog. Powered by four RS-25 engines and two boosters, the SLS rocket produces more than 8 million pounds of thrust to power missions to the Moon and, ultimately, Mars. The twin five-segment solid rocket boosters produce more than 75% of the rocket’s thrust during the first two minutes of ascent. This latest booster test will take place as teams at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida begin assembling the boosters for Artemis I, the first launch of SLS and NASA’s Orion spacecraft. The SLS rocket, Orion spacecraft, Gateway, and human landing system are part of NASA’s backbone for deep space exploration. The Artemis program is the next step in human space exploration and is part of America’s broader Moon to Mars exploration approach, in which astronauts will explore the Moon. Experience gained there will enable humanity’s next giant leap: sending humans to Mars.

<media:description>OK , so I'm getting more and more annoyed about the headlines floating around about an upcoming asteroid hitting Earth - there's one about September 6th, others about November. These types of scaremongering nonsense just get regurgitated time and time again and all it does is feed into people's fears. We've had a pretty crappy 2020 but to imply that its going to get worse because of an asteroid strike is utterly irresponsible. Remember , when NASA talk about a close approach they talk in thousands if not MILLIONS of miles from Earth. Talk of asteroids buzzing Earth, or on collision courses are just there as clickbait and nothing more Im afraid! #asteroid #earth #2020 Thanks for watching - why not support this channel and help us grow. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCakgsb0w7QB0VHdnCc-OVEA/join Subscribe For More Videos Like This: http://www.youtube.com/user/ouramazingspace?sub_confirmation=1 See my latest videos : https://www.youtube.com/user/ouramazingspace/videos Bringing you the BEST Space and Astronomy videos online.

<media:description>SpaceX is targeting Sunday, August 30 at 7:18 p.m. EDT, or 23:18 UTC, for Falcon 9’s launch of the SAOCOM 1B mission, which will carry the SAOCOM 1B spacecraft to orbit in addition to two rideshare payloads, Tyvak-0172 and PlanetiQ’s GNOMES-1. The mission will lift off from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. This mission marks SpaceX’s first launch to a polar orbit from the East Coast, and the first polar launch from Florida in decades. Falcon 9’s first stage previously launched Dragon to the International Space Station for SpaceX’s 19th and 20th commercial resupply missions, and it also supported launch of SpaceX’s ninth Starlink mission. Following stage separation, SpaceX will land Falcon 9 on Landing Zone 1 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. SAOCOM 1B will deploy approximately 14 minutes after launch, GNOMES-1 and Tyvak-0172 will deploy approximately 61 and 62 minutes after liftoff. You can watch the launch webcast here, starting about 15 minutes before liftoff. #SpaceX #SAOCOM1b #SpaceXlanding 00:00 Launch: 00:26 Landing : 07:40 Satellite Deployment: 14:33</media:description>

<media:description>So this morning launch of ULA's Delta IV heavy almost happened. The launch was aborted literally at the last second. This mission – NROL-44 was to launch a payload for National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) , supporting US national security The launch had already been scrubbed the night before. After that abort ULA said the issue was with a critical ground pneumatics control system With the launch rescheduled for 24 hours later, everything was looking good – and the countdown had entered its final phase. With the commentator even declaring “Liftoff....” as T-0 was reached. Before announcing they had had a hot fire abort. ULA released a tweet saying, rhe launch of a United Launch Alliance #DeltaIVHeavy carrying the #NROL44 mission for the National Reconnaissance Office was scrubbed today due to an unexpected condition during terminal count at approximately three seconds before liftoff. They went on to say that it would take at least 7 days for another launch attempt TORY BRUNO – CEO of ULA said The bird is in good shape. This was an automatic abort during the ignition sequence. Cause appears to have been in the ground system. System functioned as intended to protect the vehicle and payload. Whether the failure detected tonight was connected to yesterday's abort isn't clear and they could be two completely separate issues. But , from a ULA perspective, their systems worked as they should. They detected an anomaly and they shut down the launch automatically – with the rocket and its payload being protected, which of course is their priority. Of course, the spectacular fireball that occurs before the launch of a DELTA IV Heavy can surprise some people and could give the impression of problem in itself. However, this is perfectly normal for this launch system and the rocket is designed to be protected from the fire and heat. The fireball occurs as hydrogen is pushed through the engines a few seconds before being mixed with oxygen – as that hydrogen leaves the engine it rises up the side of the rocket and is ignited once the engines fire.

<media:description>So in the wee hours of this morning SpaceX completed another successful Starlink mission - deployed 57 satellites. This means there are nearly 600 Starlinks orbiting the Earth (5 of which have been deorbited since launch) Normally SpaceX would send up 60 at a time. On this mission they launched 57 as they were carrying two satellites for a customer. Of course, Starlink has been controversial in some quarters with concerns raised from the astronomy community as the effect of the satellites are having on viewing the cosmos. On this mission all 57 Starlinks had their own sunshade - a visor that is designed to significantly cut down on the reflected light. This video will cover the launch and landing of the SpaceX Falcon 9 as well as the deployment of the Starlink satellites Thanks for watching - why not support this channel and help us grow. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCakgsb0w7QB0VHdnCc-OVEA/join Subscribe For More Videos Like This: http://www.youtube.com/user/ouramazingspace?sub_confirmation=1 See my latest videos : https://www.youtube.com/user/ouramazingspace/videos Bringing you the BEST Space and Astronomy videos online.

<media:description>This video was taken originally by the crewmembers aboard the Soyuz TMA-16M spacecraft which docked to the International Space Station at 9:33 p.m. EDT March 27, 2015. Using AI software, it has been upscaled to 4K revealing more detail of this spectacular approach and arrival at the ISS. I know many will ask about the "objects" which look like they are whizzing past the capsule - this is nothing more than the cryogenic remnants of the maneuvering thrusters which can also be seen here https://twitter.com/AstroKomrade/status/893260442457571328?s=20 NASA astronaut Scott Kelly and Russian cosmonauts Mikhail Kornienko and Gennady Padalka arrived just six hours after launching from Baikonur, Kazakhstan, completing four orbits around the Earth before catching up with the orbiting laboratory. The vehicle docked to the Poisk module (also known as the Mini-Research Module 2) on the space-facing side of the Russian Service Module. The spinning object in view is an antenna that is part of the automatic rendezvous and docking system known as KURS.
